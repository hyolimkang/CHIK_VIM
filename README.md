## üìÅ Project Structure
```markdown

sim_functions_final.R
1. Ixchiq
2. Vimkunya

FOI = base_beta * Sum(I) / N assuming homogenous mixing across ages
target_ages = indexses all eligibile age groups (20 age groups <1 to >80 years)
total_supply = target_pop * total_coverage
how fast = weekly_dose_total = total_supply * weekly_delivery_speed

protection mechanism ---
1. infection blocking: successful vaccinations moved people out of S and adds to V
2. disease-only blocking: infections still occur but progression to symptomatic diseases is reduced by the coverage (VE * VC)
